# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Experience Data Analysis
The goal of this project was to analyze guest feedback (i.e. beliefs, emotions, and sentiments) about Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and identify new competitive advantages in hidden patterns by better understanding the fans.

Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is one of the most ambitous and immersive themed experiences ever created. It opened at Disneyland in Anaheim, California on May 31, 2019 and Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida on August 29, 2019. Each of these 2 themed areas cost an estimated $1 billion and feature over 14 acres of attractions, shops, and restaurants.

## Data Type
There are 2 types of data: operational data and experience data. For this analysis, I used experience data.

### Operational Data
* Tangible records of tangible activities like sales (tickets, merchandise, concessions), finance and HR
* Data about the past
* Tells you what happened

### Experience Data
* Human feedback that points to the gaps between what you think is happening and whatâ€™s really happening
* Data about the future
* Tells you why it's happening

## Data Sources
For this analysis, I focused on experience data collected from:
* Online Survey
* Twitter
* Google Trends

## Online Survey Data
I created a survey using Google Forms and collected 165 responses from various Reddit subreddits including: 

* r/StarWars 
* r/WaltDisneyWorld 
* r/disneyparks 
* r/DisneyWorld 
* r/Disneybound 
* r/GalaxiesEdge 
* r/DisneyTravel 
* r/Disneyland

### Age Groups of Survey Participants
Below is a pie chart that visualizes survey participation by age group. Ages 25-34 represent the largest age group who participated in the survey. The next 2 largest age groups are the adjacent youngest and oldest age groups making the largest representation 18-44. The smallest participating age groups are the youngest (18 and under) and the oldest (65 plus).

### Experience Ranking by Age Group
Below you'll see the ranked importance of each experience by age group. Across all age groups, the most important experiences are the rides with Rise of the Resistance as #1 and Smugglers Run as #2. After the attraction, the middle three age groups comprising 18-44 were most interested in Ogas Cantina after the attractions while both the youngest and oldest age groups were interested in the shopping experiences primarily Savis and Droid Depot. Den of Antiquities is a popular shopping location across all age groups. Den of Antiquties is like a souvenir shop meets museum.

### Correlations
Below are the correlations between experiences. The darker the blue, the more likely someone is to be interested in those experiences together. We see that Savis and Droid Depot are both of interest together.

## Twitter Sentiment Analysis
For the Twitter sentiment analysis, I used a dataset of 43,158 tweets using the hashtag #galaxysedge from 10/17/19 to 7/15/20. Below are 2 visualizations of the top words in the dataset after text processing with the Natural Language Toolkit.

### Determining Sentiment
I used the Natural Language Toolkit to determine polarity. Sentiment is determined by the following polarity scores:

* Polarity greater than 0 is positive
* Polarity equal to 0 is neutral
* Polarity less than 0 is negative

Based on the polarity scores, you can see that overall sentiment is mostly neurtral and positive.

## Clustering
To further analyze processed text from the Twitter dataset, I used the k-means clustering algorithm with the scikit-learn machine learning library. 

### Determining the Number of Clusters
To do this I used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters which in this case is 3.

Below is a visualization of the 3 clusters of processed text from the Twitter dataset.

### Most Important Words
Every word in the processed text dataset is given a score to determine which words are most important to make the cluster.

#### Cluster 1

#### Cluster 2

#### Cluster 3

## Search Trends
Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.
