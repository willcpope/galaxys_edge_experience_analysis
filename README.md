There are 2 types of data:


O-data: Operational data are things like sales data, finance data, HR data, tangible records of tangible activities.

X-Data: This is the experience data, the human factor data — the beliefs, the emotions, and the sentiments. X-data is the human feedback that points to the gaps between what you think is happening and what’s really happening. "

O-data is data about the past. X-data is about the future. 

O-data tells you what happened. X-data tells you why it’s happening.
